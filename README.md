#digital-concrete
Description:

Digital Concrete is at its' core a poetry generator to create 
new meaning in the 'post-digital' sphere of the internet. 
Playing With meaning, layout and the spacing of letters by 
creating digital-concrete poetry.  It does this by taking user 
input in the python terminal which then is merged with a source 
that the user can choose from. The amount of words and lines 
will be asked and finally a title will be created.


The Python code then exports it as an HTML file with CSS. 
Using Paged.js it will automatically generate a layout for 
A6 page. Using Rando.js variable spacing and font size changes
every time the page is refreshed. This could then be printed on
paper and added in the physical publication if desired.

Using Digital Concrete:


1. Open the Digital Concrete folder into Visual Studio code.

2. Run Digital Concrete.py using the arrow button on the top right.

3. The terminal will say: "Write down your input". The more input 
   inserted, the more you will see it come back and make meaningful
   change in the source you will select in step x  After you've inserted 
   your input, Digital Concrete will place your it into Userinput.txt

4. You will be asked: "How many lines per word do you want?"
   And "how many lines do you want?". This will put a hard limit
   on the amount of lines the code wil generate.

5. The terminal will ask you what file to merge. Choose an option
   associated with a number. Digital Concrete will now merge
   Your input with the chosen file.
   
6. Lastly it is time to write the title of your name in the terminal.
   Digital Concrete will export your text as an HTML file

7. Select result.html in Studio visual code and look for 'Go Live'
   in the bottom right corner. This will launch the page. Paged.js
   will automatically create a layout with your text in combination 
   with rando.js to spice it up with random spacing and font size.

8. Refresh the page until a desired outcome is required.

9. Experiment! Have fun with it. Add your own sources

Further development:

This project is in its early stages, but I am proud of what I have accomplished.
Some other ideas that could surely be fun are:

- The creation of ascii art / concrete poetry in a more refined way.
- Making a website for easier acces and easy user-input.
- Adding more sources for interesting results.

This is part of a physical publication. Do you want to add something to this project
physically or digitally? Please contact me.
